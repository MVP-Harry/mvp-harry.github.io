## Intro
This is my desperate attempt to study for the Biology exam.

* Chapter 7 & 11: Membrane Transport and Cell Signaling
* Chapter 8: Metabolism
* Chapter 9: Cellular Respiration and Fermentation
* Chapter 10: Photosynthesis

## Membrane Transport and Cell Signaling
* Overview
    * Membrane exhibits selective permeability
    * Phospholipids (amphipathic molecules)
        * Hydrophilic head
        * Hydrophobic tail
    * The fluid mosaic model
* Fluidity of membranes
    * Shift laterally (but can't flip because of Hydrophobic tails)
    * Unsaturated (more fluid) vs saturated (most stable)
    * Cholesterol
* Membrane Proteins and Their Functions
    * Integral proteins
    * Peripheral proteins
    * Six functions of membrane proteins
        1. Transport
        2. Enzymatic activity
        3. Anchor (attachment to the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix) (?)
        4. Cell-cell recognition
        5. Interceullar joining (?)
        6. Signal Transduction
    * Membrane faces are different from each other
* Selective Permeability
    * Hydrophobic molecules can cross easily
    * Polar molecules, such as sugars, cannot cross easily
* Transport Proteins
    * Channel proteins
        * Have a hydrophilic channel that allows passage of hydrophilic substances
    * Carrier proteins
        * Bind to molecules and change shape to shuttle them across the membrane
    * A transport protein is specific
* Tonicity
    * A is *hypertonic* to B, if A has a higher solute concentration than B
    * A is *hypotonic* to B, if A has a lower solute concentration than B
    * Plant cells want to be in a hypotonic environment, so that they will gain water (become turgid)
* Passive transport
    * Diffusion of a substance across a membrane with *no energy* investment
    * Substances diffuse down their concentration gradient
    * The diffusion of a substance across a biological membrane is passive transport
    * Osmosis is the diffusion of water across membranes
    * Facilitated diffusion
        * Still passive; just speed up the process
        * Examples: channel protein
* Active Transport
    * Move solutes against their concentration gradient
    * Needs energy, usually in the form of ATP
    * Example: Sodium-potassium pump
        * 3 Na+ in 
        * 2 K+ out
* Cotransport
    * Active transport of a solute indirectly drives transport of other solutes
* Bulk Transport
    * Requires energy
    * Occurs by exocytosis and endocytosis
        * Exocytosis 
        * Endocytosis - cell takes in molecules
            * Phagocytosis (cellular eating)
            * Pinocytosis (cellular drinking)
            * Receptor-mediated endocytosis
* Cell Signaling
    * Short-distance signaling: paracrine signaling
    * Neuron-related signaling: synaptic signaling
    * Long-distance signaling: endocrine signaling (through blood vessels)
    * Autocrine: signaling with itself
    
* Three Stages of Cell Signaling
    * Reception
    * Transduction
    * Response (activation)
* Reception: the Binding of a Signaling Molecule to a Receptor Protein
    * Binding between a signal molecule (*ligand*) and receptor is highly-specific
    * Receptors
        * G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)
            * G proteins bind to GTP (a Canadian cousin of ATP)
            * G protein is active if and only if GTP is bound to the G protein
        * Ligand-gated ion channels
            * When a signal molecule binds to a receptor, the gate changes shape and allows specific ions to pass
* Transduction
    * Involves multiple steps
        * Can amplify a signal
    * The molecules that relay a signal are mostly proteins
    * Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation
        * Protein kinases transfer phosphates from ATP to proteins
            * Change protein from inactive to active 
        * Protein phosphatases remove the phosphates from proteins 
            * Turning off the signal transduction pathway
    * Second messengers
        * Activates the series of proteins
        * Cyclic AMP and ions are common second messengers
* Response
    * Response may occur in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus
    * Transcription factor
    * QUESTION: explain in human language

## Metabolism
* Catabolic vs Anabolic
    * Catabolic pathways release energy by breaking down complex molecules
    * Anabolic pathways consume energy to build complex molecules
* Exergonic vs Endergonic
    * Exergonic reactions have negative net free energy (delta G is negative)
    * Endergonic absorbs free energy (delta G is positive)
* ATP
    * Energy coupling
        * The use of exergonic process to drive an endergonic one
        * Mediated by ATP
    * ATP drives endergonic reactions by phosphorylation
    * ATP can be regenerated by an addition of phosphate group to ADP
    * Cycle of life
* Enzymes
    * An enzyme is a catalytic protein that speeds up reactions
    * Properties of enzymes
        * Activation energy is the initial energy required to start a chemical reaction; enzymes lower the activation energy
        * Enzymes do not affect the change in free energy
    * Induced fit of enzyme to the substrate brings chemical groups of the active site into positions that enhance their ability to catalyze the reaction
    * An enzyme's activity can be affected by:
        * Temperature and pH
            * Each enzyme has an optimal temperature and pH
    * Cofactors
        * Non-protein enzyme helpers (recall that enzymes are proteins)
        * An organic cofactor is called a coenzyme
    * Enzyme inhibitors
        * Competitive inhibitors
            * Bind to the active site of an enzyme
        * Noncompetitive inhibitors
            * Bind to another part of an enzyme to make the active site less effective
        * Allosteric regulation (QUESTION)
        * Feedback inhibition
            * The end product of a metabolic pathway shuts down the pathway
            * Prevents waste

## Cellular Respiration and Fermentation
* Overview
    * Cellular respiration is made up of both aerobic and anaerobic respiration (otherwise known as fermentation)
    * Exergonic
    * The fuel (i.e. glucose) gets oxidized, while oxygen is being reduced
    * Multi-step process: 
        * glycolysis (occurs in cytoplasm)
        * pyruvate oxidation and citric acid cycle (kreb's cycle)
        * oxidative phosphorylation (generates most of the ATP)
* Redox
    * Reduced (gain an electron)
    * Oxidized (lose an electron)
* Glycolysis
    * Breaks down glucose into two pyruvates
    * Investment phase 
        * Uses 2 ATP
        * Breaks glucose into PGAL
    * Payoff phase
        * PGAL turns into pyruvate
        * Gains 4 ATP and 2 NADH (reduced NAD+)
* Citric Acid Cycle
    * Occurs in the mitochondria
    * Pyruvate oxidation
        * Take a carbon from pyruvate, attach CoA, and form Acetyl CoA
        * Produces a CO2 and a NADH
    * Kreb's cycle
        * Acetyl CoA (2 carbon) + oxaloacetate (4 carbon) -> citrate acid (6 carbon)
        * Citrate acid -> gets oxidize a bunch of times -> malate -> oxaloacetate
        * Notice that 3 total carbons are lost in the entire cycle
        * Each cycle (counting pyruvate oxidation) produces 4 NADH, 1 FADH, 1 ATP
* Oxidative Phosophorylation
    * Oxygen likes to be reduced (electron acceptor) -> forms H2O at the end
    * NADH -> CoQ -> CytC -> ... -> pumps H+ across the membrane -> O2 is the final electron acceptor -> forms H2O
    * Accounts for the majority of the ATPs produced (~28)
* Fermentation
    * Only uses glycolysis to generate ATP
    * Alcohol fermentation
    * Lactic acid fermentation (when O2 is scarce)
* How Other Molecules Enter The Catabolic Pathway
    * Proteins
        * Strip the NH3
        * Goes to kreb cycle
    * Fats
        * Fatty acids need an additional step called beta oxidation, which yield acetyl CoA
## Photosynthesis
* Photosynthesis Overview
  * Sunlight (photons) + CO2 + H2O -> carbohydrate + O2
  * Integral for life
  * Photosynthesis can be broken down into two stages
      * Light reaction (light dependent)
          * H2O -> O2
          * ATP, NADPH
      * Calvin cycle (light independent)
          * Needs CO2
          * Creates G3P
* Light Reaction
  * light + H2O -> ATP + NADPH + O2 (by-product)
  * Leaf -> mesophyll (interior tissue of the leaf) -> chloroplasts -> thykloid (little disks)
  * Lighr reaction takes place in thykloid membranes
      * Light goes to PS2 and PS1 (called the linear electron flow)
          * Photosystems consist of a reaction-center complex and a light-harvesting complex
      * Chlorophyll called P680 donates an electron, which then is used to pump protons
      * P680+ is an ion, which then grabs the electron from H2O. H2O gets broken down into 1/2 O2 (where the oxygen by-product comes from) and 2H+
      * Photophosorlation: Stroma has low H+ concentration gradient. Protons are pumped inside to the thykloid space.
      * PS1 has P700
          * The electron is used to reduce NADP+ to NADPH
          * P700 then gets the electron from the low-energy electron from P680
* Calvin Cycle
  * Uses the energy from ATP and NADPH to reduce CO2 to sugar
  * Anabolic
  * The carbohydrate produced directly from Calvin cycle is G3P, not glucose (cycle takes place 3 times)
  * Carbon fixation
      * Each CO2 molecule, one at a time, gets attached to a five-carbon sugar named RuBP
      * *Rubisco* is the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction
      * The result is a six-carbon sugar that gets split in half immediately -> 3-phosphoglycerate
  * Reduction
      * Each 3-phosphoglycerate receives an additional phosphate group from ATP
      * Eventually it becomes G3P
      * Note that for every 3 CO2, 6 G3P are formed, but only 1 can count as a net gain
  * Regeneration of the CO2 acceptor (RuBP)
      * The five molecules of G3P (worth 15 carbons) gets rearranged to 3 RuBPs
  * Consumes a total of 9 ATP and 6 NADPH
* Evolution of Alternative Mechanisms
  * Need to adapt to hot and arid climates
  * Photorespiration: Rubisco sometimes also fixes oxygen
      * Produces a two-carbon compound
  * C4 plants
