## Intro
This Thursday, the chess team got invited to the State Capitol after winning the state championship. We ended up having a lot of fun and taking lots of selfies and videos, so I decided to edit them into a vlog!

Thanks a lot, team! The past two years playing chess with y'all was absolutely amazing :D

## Enjoy!
