## Introduction
Recently, I decided to "restart" my competitive programming [journey](https://mvp-harry.github.io/posts/let-the-journey-begin/). One of the things that I hadn't done well enough is learning from my mistakes and the problems that I couldn't solve; therefore, in this post, I'm going to list all the dynamic programming problems that I couldn't solve from [USACO Guide](https://usaco.guide), describe the solution in my own words, and summarize the key learning. In this post, I will specifically focus on dynamic programming problems.

## List of Problems That I Couldn't Solve
* [DROUGHT](http://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=1185) (USACO 2022 January, Gold)
* [BOVINE GENETICS](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=1066) (USACO 2020 December, Gold)
* [CODING COMPANY](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1665) (CSES)
* [KNAPSACK](https://oj.uz/problem/view/NOI18_knapsack) (Singapore NOI, 2018)
