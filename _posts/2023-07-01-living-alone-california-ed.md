_A night in California_

## Intro
This summer, I started working as a computer science instructor for AlphaStar Academy. AlphaStar offered me to teach either online or in-person, and I ultimately decided to choose in-person despite having to leave home and live alone in California. The reasoning behind the choice is mostly because I want to gain something from this experience as well (other than money, duh). In-person teaching gives me the opportunity to learn from more experienced instructors and build deeper relationships with my fellow peers.

Anyways, as you can probably imagine, living in California alone is quite different from what I normally do, so I figure that I would write something to record all of this.

## One Week In...
1. How are there so many Teslas???
    * Although Teslas are sort of cool...
2. Working is tough. Being a teacher is even tougher because you have to deal with kids.
3. Don't just do what you're told to do. Go above and beyond.
4. Vegan chicken tastes so bad.
5. Wish that there's a mind reader that can help me read my students' minds...
6. Spider Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a very good movie.
7. California's weather is not bad at all, especially if you have an AC.
8. You need to pay taxes for every purchase in California, unfortunately.
9. Not every instructor gets paid equally... (unfortunately)
10. Walking in the morning is nice, but walking after work when you're already exhausted is a nightmare.
11. Public transportation sucks in California (and in U.S in general).
12. Always go to work early if possible.
13. Paul Graham's essays are always a good read.
> So you need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way to do that is to be curious. Try lots of things, meet lots of people, read lots of books, ask lots of questions.
> 
> That's the key: consistency. People who do great things don't get a lot done every day. They get something done, rather than nothing.
>
> Be aggressively willing to admit that you're mistaken. Once you've admitted you were mistaken about something, you're free. Till then you have to carry it.
14. *Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow* is a great book.
15. Don't walk alone after 10pm.
