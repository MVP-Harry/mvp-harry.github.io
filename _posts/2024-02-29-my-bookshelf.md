One of my new year resolutions is to read 20 books in 2024. So here's the list (in reverse chronological order) :D

1. [_The Last Lecture_ by Randy Pausch](#the_last_lecture)
2. [_You've Reached Sam_ by by Dustin Dao](#you_ve_reached_sam)
3. [三体 _(Three-Body)_ by 刘慈欣](#three_body)

## _The Last Lecture_ by Randy Pausch <a name="the_last_lecture"></a>

- After Professor Randy Pausch of CMU got diagnosed of terminal pancreatic cancer at 47, he gave a moving last lecture that went over how he has achieved his childhood dreams, how to enable others' dreams, and some suggestions on how to live a fulfilling life. What struck me the most was how Randy didn't seem to have any major regrets, even though his life was shorter than most.
- It led me to ponder about my own dreams - what are they, would I be able to achieve them in 30 years, and would I have any regrets?
    - To do: make a list of things that I want to do in 30 years.
- <p>Overall rating: &starf; &starf; &starf; &starf; &star;. A very touching and inspiring book albeit some chapters are a bit scattered.</p> 

## _You've Reached Sam_ by Dustin Dao <a name="you_ve_reached_sam"></a>

- If you saw me crying while eating at Ackerman, it's because I was reading this book, not because the food was that bad.
- <p>Overall rating: &starf; &starf; &starf; &starf; &star;. You'll love this book if you love romance and don't mind being sad. </p>

## 三体 *(Three-Body)* by 刘慈欣 <a name="three_body"></a>
<img src="/assets/img/three_body.jpg" alt="three_body" width="200"/>
- This series will blow your mind. No other science fiction books that I've read so far comes close to this level of creativity. There are so many interesting characters and concepts in the book, and you'll simply be left saying "oh wow" after reading.
- <p>Overall rating: &starf; &starf; &starf; &starf; &star;. Strongly recommend. </p>
