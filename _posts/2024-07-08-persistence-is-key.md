I hate being distracted all the time. I used to be able to focus well, but now it feels like I have ADHD.
I hate not improving at all. Am I even better than myself 2 years ago?
I hate not doing what I promised to do. I promised to quit league, to run, to improve my competitive programming skill. Yet I have broken every single of these promises.
I hate not being able to up my game to the "next level". I still haven't published that paper I wanted. I suck at chess now. I still haven't crossed master on codeforces.

One of the most important reasons is my lack of persistence.
