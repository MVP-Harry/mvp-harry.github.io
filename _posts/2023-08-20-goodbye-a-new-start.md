A significant portion of my friends have already left for college, and I will only be briefly in town before I leave for UCLA in mid September. 

It's tough saying goodbye to so many friends, whom I shared so many fond memories with. Thankfully, goodbye is not an end, but just a beginning to an eventual reunion and the limitless possibilities ahead of us :D

Thanks to everyone who made the last 4 years so great!

## A New Start

_UCLA Orientation!!!_

I went to the New Student Orientation at UCLA recently. It's my first time on campus, and everything was amazing (maybe except for the tiny dorm). As a very brief summary: people are nice, campus is gorgeous, and food is amazing! What else can you ask for?! :D 

I made a lot of friends, despite the orientation being just a few days. We went to Carpe Noctem as team "J++" and even though we didn't win, it was an absolute blast; we played so much Uno, Slap Jack (ouch!), Spoon, and a banana crossword game (?); we had a ton of fun complaining about the hills/sore legs and the stressful process of course selection, while listening to Jacob and Naomi talking about all kinds of UCLA myths and legends, etc.

Really excited for the next 4 years!
