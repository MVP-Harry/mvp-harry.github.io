At the beginning of the school year, back when I was still interested in Macro, the concept of business cycles stood out to me, as it has quite an astonishing resemblance to life. The business cycle states that, in a macro economy, there are alternating periods of economic growths and downturns; the former is known as expansions, and the latter as recessions. And when a recession gets *really* out of hands, it becomes a depression.

Life is just like that. There are the good days. The days that the moment I wake up, I feel ready to go and do something big; the days when I'm at my absolute best - mind is clear, energy at an all time high, and even the jokes are funny; days when I go to bed all exhausted, but simultaneously satisfied of what I've accomplished. Oh, how much I love those days. The days when the little things are enjoyable, the days that make you feel hopeful.

But they never seem to last. All of sudden, everything starts to fall apart. You lose all the motivations, you struggle with your emotions, you try to think, but your brain just feels stuck.

In the end, most economies have an overall upward trend despite having to deal with recessions. Not sure if I can say the same for life though...
