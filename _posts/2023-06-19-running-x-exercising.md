## Update 7/21/2023
Sadly I've not been able to stick with my original plan :( Might restart in the near future.

## Intro

Can't believe that I would ever say this, but running is actually quite fun! Sure, it drains your legs and sucks the life out of you every single damn time, but it is equally fulfilling at the same time. Plus, all the runner friends that I have are very disciplined, so... hopefully I'll be as disciplined as they are by becoming a runner myself :D

## Goals

I would run/exercise 6 times a week, with Sunday being the only rest day. Ideally, the run would be 45 minutes to an hour, which would then translate to roughly 5 miles or more, depending on the pace. I'm still trying to figure out what the plan is for other types of workouts, but currently I plan to do 2-4 sets of 25 pushups each day, and I'll likely add more along the way.

To better keep track of my progress, here's my [running log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QnQdesfy5Pc-yI6KwSfk4h2cn67DaWlpZj3ZMHR0Ago/edit?usp=sharing).
