## Just a Few Words To Myself (9/29/2023)
* Remember that I have a lot of goals to achieve in college. Just because other people are relaxing and having fun doesn't mean I should do the same.
* Work hard, work hard, and work hard. I can clearly see my own improvements when I work hard, but I just have to be consistent.
* I can make the ICPC World Finals (one day at least...)

## Intro
With UCLA starting in a few days, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. In order to make college life productive, meaningful, and fun at the same time, I made a list of "Do's and Don'ts" that contain some of the most important principles and mentalities that I hope to achieve in the first quarter.

## The Do's
1. **Be disciplined**. Have goals and *take action* to execute them.
2. **Be proactive**. UCLA is a huge school, and good opportunities are always rare, so be proactive and take actions sooner!
3. **Be open-minded**. College is a great place to explore new possibilities. Read a lot of books - including books that seem "irrelevant" at the time. Make a lot of new friends.
4. **Be focused**. Work hard and play hard, but don't do them at the same time. Stay focused (especially in the morning).
5. **Be healthy**. A healthy body and mind is the basis to everything. So, exercise regularly (play an intramural sport!), eat a lot of veggies, and have a reasonable bed time.

## The Don'ts
1. **Don't procrastinate**. I've developed a rather serious procrastination syndrome in high school, and I hope to resolve it in college. Procrastination really brings no benefits, so don't wait and hesitate, start taking actions!
2. **Don't isolate**. Make friends and don't be afraid to ask for help.
3. **Don't be influenced by other's bad habits**. Just why???
4. **Don't be distracted by online entertainments** (i.e. video games, social media, YouTube, etc.). This is rather specific, but online entertainments have become a serious source of distractions. Know when to stay away from them.

## Goals for the First Quarter
* All A's in class
* Make the ICPC team (bonus: make the North American Championship with my team :D)
* Explore the clubs: ACM (ICPC obviously, but also maybe the cybersecurity team?), Linux User Group, chess club, Chinese Union (is that a thing?), etc.
* Read 3 books: Freud's *Dream Interpretation*, *A History of Western Philosophy* by Bertrand Russell, and *The Red Book*.
* Exercise: 5 days of a week. Either find a basketball group to join or just run :D
