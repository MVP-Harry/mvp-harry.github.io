## Introduction
Recently, I've become quite interested in the mysterious Wall Street, so I've set out to learn more about the financial market through reading a series of books. The first book among which is *The Big Short* by Michael Lewis. Prior to reading the book, I've also watched the [movie adaptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Short_(film)), but the book definitely provided much more details that I was looking for. 

Lewis explained the 2008 Financial Crisis from the *short side* - through the lenses of hedge fund managers and investment bankers that shorted the housing market, which made the story much more interesting for me. After reading the book, I felt that I've gained a basic understanding of the causes and impact of the 2008 Crisis, as well as how Wall Street functions. In particular, I now understand the roles of mortgage-backed securities, CDOs, investment banks, and credit rating agencies during the crisis.

## Major Players in the 2008 Financial Crisis

### Mortgage-backed securities (MBS)
+ MBS is an investment product similar to bonds, where investors receive monthly payments
+ Each MBS consists of a collection of home loans
+ Essentially, MBS investors lend their money to homebuyers, where banks act as an intermediary between them
+ MBS is designed to diversify the pool of loans, thus, reducing risks

### Collateralized debt obligations (CDOs)
+ A complicated financial derivative that repackages mortgages/bonds into a single product divided into different levels based on the risks
+ A CDO is like a skyscraper, with each floor being mortgages/bonds. The lower the floor, the higher the risks of the bonds that it contains
+ Mostly for institutional traders

### Investment banks
+ A big investment bank does a little bit of everything
    * Financial/banking services
    * Provides advice (consulting)
    * Market making
+ Examples: Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, CitiGroup
+ Foreign investment banks like UBS (Switzerland), Credit Suisse (Switzerland), Deutsche (Germany) also played a major role in the 2008 Financial Crisis

### Rating Agencies
* Financial institutions that provide ratings (triple-A, triple-B etc.) to assets
* During the 2008 Financial Crisis, ratings of garbage CDOs remained high
* Examples: S&P, Moody's, Fitch Group

## Next Up
Next, I will read *Liar's Poker*, another book by Lewis, which focuses on his experience working for the Salomon Brothers.
