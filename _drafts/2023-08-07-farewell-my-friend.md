Dear Victor,

I don't really know how to start this letter, so here we go...

When I first moved to Portland, going to school was always miserable. Language barriers and cultural differences were real, and I was always scared that other people would make fun of me; I didn't have much, if any friends; I sat in the library during lunch because I didn't know where else I could go to. I didn't feel that I belonged, and I thought nothing was going to change in the foreseeable future.

I was wrong, thankfully. On one random afternoon in the second semester of Sophomore year, I found myself playing card games with some random classmates that I've barely talked to. Little did I know, in this group of friends, I found my best friend and brother.

Victor, you might've not realized, but what you've done meant the world to me. You opened a door for me, and I could just follow you. Every adventure that we've went on is something to remember: group hangouts with TAC - watching Zombie Land, playing card games, going to Panda Express (...), watching movies, going to homecoming (first homecoming was so mid though), waking up at 5 to watch the sunrise on a foggy day; and then there was the tent group


Outline:
* Immensely grateful for Victor as a friend and brother
    * Adopted me under his wing since Sophomore year
    * Single-handedly changed the course of my high school experience
    * So many great memories
* 武侠
* Looking upon the future
