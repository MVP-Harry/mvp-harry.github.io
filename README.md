### Who am I?
My name is Harry, a rising college freshman. I love computer science and mathematics, have some vague interests in history and economics, and occasionally enjoy literature. I am also a hardcore Warriors fan and a chess enthusiast!

### Why this blog?
Writing sucks. It takes so much time and effort, and even when you try your best, the words never come out as pretty as they sound in your head.

But from time to time, there would be a sudden urge for me to pick up my pen and jot down my feelings. The golden rays of sunrise, the hot breeze of summer, the warm, fuzzy feeling of lying on the grass, the smell of freshly brewed coffee; these hopeful things, they inspire me to write. The late-night insomnia, the bruised relationships, the endless cycle of anxiety, the overwhelming loneliness; these dark times, they also inspire me to write. Thus, the creation of this blog.
